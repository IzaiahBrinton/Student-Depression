Student Depression Analysis – Project Overview
Problem Statement
Student mental health is becoming a major concern, with depression affecting academic performance, personal well-being, and even safety. But while awareness is growing, real insight into what’s causing it is still limited. This project explores a dataset focused on student depression to identify key patterns, risk factors, and areas for potential intervention.

Approach & Methodology
I used a data-driven approach to dig into the mental health patterns among students:

Data Cleaning
Removed missing or inconsistent data, standardized formats, and ensured the dataset was ready for analysis.

Exploratory Analysis
Looked at individual factors like sleep, CGPA, family history, and suicidal thoughts to understand how each relates to depression.

Visualization
Created clear, interpretable charts showing the connection between specific lifestyle and academic variables and depression levels.

 Key Insights & Findings
Work/Study Hours had the strongest connection to depression. Students putting in 8+ hours a day were much more likely to report symptoms.

Sleep Duration and Financial Stress also played major roles, both strongly tied to depression.

Suicidal Thoughts were a major predictor — highlighting the need for urgent intervention when these are reported.

CGPA, surprisingly, had minimal predictive power — showing that academic performance alone isn’t a reliable mental health indicator.

How to Use This Project

This project can be adapted for school mental health initiatives, early-warning systems, or academic research.
